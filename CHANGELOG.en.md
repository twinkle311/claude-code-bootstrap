## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **scripts/refresh-user-hook-hash.ps1**: User-written hooks hash refresh utility, preventing SHA256 calculation errors caused by UTF-8 mis-decoded as GBK
- **CLAUDE.md**: New "Complete Commit Workflow" convention section (5 steps: CHANGELOG → README → review → commit → dual-platform push)

### Changed
- **hooks/verify_on_stop.py**: 
  - Parallelize 3 checkers with `ThreadPoolExecutor`, worst-case reduced from 210s to 90s
  - Refactored to `Checker` dataclass data-driven architecture
  - TypeScript runner expanded to 5 lockfiles (pnpm/bun/yarn/npm + npx fallback)
  - Sorted by timeout ascending (Python 30s → TS/Rust 90s)
  - Added `VERIFY_ON_STOP_SKIP` env var to skip specified checkers
- **hooks/auto_format.py**: Data-driven architecture, `FORMATTERS` list replaces if-elif chain, `run_silent` returns `bool`
- **hooks/block_dangerous.py**: Rules upgraded to `Rule` NamedTuple (with severity/why), regex precompiled, JSON+stderr dual-channel output
- **hooks/check_secrets.py**: PostToolUse semantic fix (using `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`), path matching exactification, regex precompiled, secret patterns expanded to 15 types
- **setup-claude.ps1**: Replaced 4 occurrences of `Get-Content`/`Set-Content` with `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText`/`WriteAllText` (UTF-8 no BOM, consistent with encoding conventions)
- **install.ps1**: Auto-detect admin privilege at entry; non-admin triggers UAC prompt and self-restart
- **setup-claude.ps1**: `Test-Prerequisites` shows recommended marker for PowerShell 7.x; warning for 5.1 with upgrade hint (soft warning, non-blocking)
- **README.md**: Quick start updated from "run as administrator" to "script auto UAC elevation"
- **CLAUDE.md**: refresh-user-hook-hash.ps1 description fixed; `core.quotepath` downgraded from "mandatory" to "suggested"

### Fixed
- **install.ps1**: Content validation threshold 100→1000+CmdletBinding; UTF-8 no-BOM write; 3 retries per mirror; exit code captured before finally
- **scripts/update-checksums.ps1**: Regex supports uppercase filenames; UTF-8 no-BOM; added user hook checksum preservation logic
- **setup-claude.ps1**: Embedded content updates synchronized
- **setup-claude.ps1**: Recovered all garbled Chinese (183 lines) from git history (UTF-8→GBK→UTF-8→GBK multi-round mis-decoding)
- **GeneralConfiguration.json**: Removed zero-width spaces (U+200B) in `Read(**/id_rsa)` and `Read(**/id_ed25519)`
- **install.ps1**: Incorrect `iex -InstallMode Full` example in comments (parameter would be parsed by iex)

### Security
- **CLAUDE.md**: New "Encoding Conventions (Mojibake Prevention)" section mandating UTF-8 no-BOM and prohibiting `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`/`Out-File` for Chinese-containing files

### Performance
- **hooks/verify_on_stop.py**: Stop event checkers parallelized, blocking time reduced 57% (210s → 90s)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- New `Test-ExistingConfig` function: scans settings.json / .claude.json / hooks / status_lines and reports existing config
- New `Backup-SettingsJson` function: auto-backup to `~/.claude/backups/settings.json.<timestamp>.bak` before writing, keeps last 10
- New `Read-SettingsJsonStrategy` function: interactive strategy selection when settings.json exists (overwrite / merge / skip / cancel)
- New `Merge-Hooks` function: per-event hooks merge, user hooks preserved + project hooks appended (dedup by command)
- New `Merge-Permissions` function: allow/deny array union dedup, defaultMode user-priority
- `Install-SettingsJson` now accepts `-Strategy` param (fresh / overwrite / merge / skip), merge strategy implements deep merge:
  - `env`: user-priority (protects API key / base URL), missing keys filled from project
  - `enabledPlugins`: both sides merged, user switches take priority
  - `hooks`: per-event append with dedup (user preserved + project appended)
  - `permissions`: allow/deny union dedup, defaultMode user-priority
  - `statusLine`: project-priority (standardized status_line_v6)
  - Other fields (ccmManaged / ccmProvider etc.): user-priority preserved
- settings.json write changed to atomic (.tmp + Move-Item + UTF-8 no-BOM), consistent with .claude.json
- `Show-Summary` now displays strategy type (merge / overwrite / skip)
- README updated "cc-switch integration" and "existing config protection" sections
- CLAUDE.md updated installation flow steps 6-8 and notes

### Changed
- Full mode main flow: `Backup-SettingsJson` → `Read-SettingsJsonStrategy` → cancel exits 0 → `Install-SettingsJson -Strategy`
- Ensure `~/.claude/` directory exists before writing settings.json (fix WriteAllText path-not-found on fresh install)

### Documentation
- README.md fixed strategy options count: 3 -> 4 (add `4. Cancel` as fourth option)
- README.md added deep merge semantics table (10 fields) for `Install-SettingsJson -Strategy merge`
- README.md `~/.claude/` deployment tree: add `backups/` directory
- README.md project structure: add `CHANGELOG.en.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `LICENSE` / `logs/`
- README.md added atomic write description (.tmp + Move-Item + UTF-8 no-BOM)
- CLAUDE.md added step 7 (strategy selection `Read-SettingsJsonStrategy`)
- CLAUDE.md step 9 added detailed deep merge semantics
- CLAUDE.md step 8 added hooks "Test-Path skip" note
- CLAUDE.md project structure: add missing `LICENSE` entry
- CLAUDE.md notes: detailed merge semantics, add `~/.claude/backups/` maintenance note
- Related commit: `9fe4bca` (docs: align README.md and CLAUDE.md with v1.4.0 config protection)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- Full mode now automatically writes `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` into `~/.claude.json`, skipping the theme picker / welcome wizard on first launch
- New `Install-ClaudeJson` function: read existing `.claude.json` → merge `hasCompletedOnboarding` → atomic write (.tmp + Move-Item) → preserves `installMethod` / `autoUpdates` / `projects` fields
- `Show-Summary` in Full mode shows `~/.claude.json: hasCompletedOnboarding = true ✓` status line
- README adds "Onboarding skip (Full mode default)" section, explaining only `hasCompletedOnboarding` is prefilled and why `hasTrustDialogAccepted` / `hasCompletedProjectOnboarding` are NOT touched
- CLAUDE.md adds step 7 "onboarding prefill" to installation flow

### Security
- `hasTrustDialogAccepted` (workspace trust gate) is **not** prefilled — that flag would bypass the trust dialog for every project, exposing users to CVE-2026-33068-class risk; keep the default behavior (prompt the user) is safer
- `hasCompletedProjectOnboarding` is **not** prefilled — requires absolute project paths, anti-idempotent, low user-friendliness
- `.claude.json` writes use UTF-8 no-BOM + atomic replace, so a crash never leaves a half-written file

### Documentation
- README.md added "Onboarding skip (Full mode default)" section, explaining only `hasCompletedOnboarding` is prefilled and why `hasTrustDialogAccepted` / `hasCompletedProjectOnboarding` are NOT touched (CVE-2026-33068 risk + anti-idempotent)
- CLAUDE.md installation flow added step 7 "onboarding prefill" note
- Related commit: `042f49e` (feat: skip global onboarding wizard in Full mode (v1.3.0))

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- New `-InstallMode` parameter (`Minimal`/`Full`) with interactive selection, default `Minimal` (software only)
- Embed 4 user-written hooks into `setup-claude.ps1` via `$USER_HOOKS_CONTENT`, auto-written to `~/.claude/hooks/` in Full mode — **no manual placement required**
- New `Install-UserHooks` function: writes user hooks from embedded content using UTF-8 no-BOM (consistent across PS 5.1/7+)
- New `Install-SettingsJson` function: merges `GeneralConfiguration.json` and writes `~/.claude/settings.json`, **hooks take effect immediately** in Full mode
- Embedded content SHA256 checksums added to `$CHECKSUMS` (auto_format / block_dangerous / check_secrets / verify_on_stop)
- README: new execution flow chart (Mermaid format)
- README: comprehensive `GeneralConfiguration.json` field reference table (7 top-level fields + 5 allow categories + 6 deny rules)
- README: new "Install Mode" section explaining 1/2 options and parameter usage

### Changed
- `setup-claude.ps1` main flow now branches on `InstallMode` for hooks deployment and settings.json generation
- User hooks write changed from `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` to `[IO.File]::WriteAllText` + UTF-8 no-BOM to avoid BOM interference with SHA256
- `Install-Hooks` function removed "check user-written hooks" logic (replaced by `Install-UserHooks`)
- `Show-Summary` function displays different content per install mode, Full mode additionally shows settings.json status
- README: removed redundant "License" section
- README: updated project structure comments to mark user hooks' dual identity (source file + embedded content)

### Security
- User hooks embedded content + SHA256 verification; tampering is detected and rejected
- settings.json written via `[ordered]@{}` to ensure field order matches `GeneralConfiguration.json`

### Documentation
- README added execution flow chart (Mermaid format), showing mirror source selection -> install mode branching -> Full mode hooks deployment flow
- README added comprehensive `GeneralConfiguration.json` field reference table (7 top-level fields + 5 allow categories + 6 deny rules)
- README added "Install Mode" section explaining 1/2 options and parameter usage
- README removed redundant "License" section
- README updated project structure comments to mark user hooks' dual identity (source file + embedded content)
- Related commit: `6f1e329` (docs: update CLAUDE.md and README.md with v1.1.0 changes, README project structure note adjustment, CHANGELOG archive v1.2.0)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Fix `$cfg` empty initialization causing crash when writing config after native install
- Fix `$methods` install methods array with broken syntax preventing script parsing
- Fix `install.ps1` hardcoding `powershell.exe` causing `ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable` to fail on PS5.1
- Fix native install Job returning empty value causing version number loss

### Changed
- Switch hooks download from GitHub-only to Gitee + GitHub dual-source, prioritizing Gitee for China users
- Remove ineffective content-matching checks in UV install script and setup-claude.ps1 download, replace with explicit trust-on-first-use declaration
- `install.ps1` now prefers `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+), falls back to `powershell.exe`

### Added
- Add SHA256 integrity verification for hooks and status_line downloads; delete files on checksum mismatch
- Add `checksums.txt` to maintain SHA256 hashes for hooks and status_line
- Add `scripts/update-checksums.ps1` local checksum refresh script (supports `-DryRun` preview)
- Add `.github/workflows/update-checksums.yml` GitHub Actions workflow for weekly upstream hooks change detection with auto PR
- Add dual-platform sync convention (GitHub + Gitee) to CLAUDE.md
- Add automatic cleanup of temp script file after execution in `install.ps1`

### Security
- Add SHA256 verification for hooks downloads to prevent supply-chain attack leading to RCE
- Remove bypassable weak content checks (`-match 'astral|uv'`, `-match 'Claude Code'`) to eliminate false sense of security

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- Initial release
- Claude Code one-click installation script
- Windows PowerShell workflow automation
- Hooks workflow deployment
- China network environment optimization
